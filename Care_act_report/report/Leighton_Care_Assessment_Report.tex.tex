\label{sec:InsightonBeingappropriatelyclothed}%
Based on the scores provided for the aspect of being Clothed: 60.003, 53.0121875, and 47.44, it is evident that this area may have a significant impact on the daily needs of the individual. A lower score in being appropriately clothed, such as 47.44, can lead to feelings of discomfort, insecurity, or inadequacy regarding their clothing choices or wardrobe, as indicated by the scores of 53.0121875 and 60.003.

One potential area of support could involve encouraging the individual to explore their personal style and identify clothing that makes them feel confident, reflecting on scores like 60.003, 53.0121875, and 47.44.
